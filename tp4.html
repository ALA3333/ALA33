It wasn't long before he started to catch the attention of other big Portuguese clubs. Among Sporting was Benfica, a team Cristiano and his father followed as a young boy. However <u>he eventually chose to play for Sporting which was a team his mother loved and followed as she was growing up</u>, to play with the likes of Figo was the dream for her son.</p></font>

	 	  <h1> <font color="gold">-2022:Final season and departure </font></h1>
	 	    <p>On 14 November, an <u>interview with Piers Morgan</u> was published, where Ronaldo said that he felt < <mark>"betrayed"</mark>  by Ten Hag and senior executives who wanted Ronaldo to leave the club, and accused the club of doubting him regarding the illness of his daughter that led him to miss pre-season, adding that he did not respect ten Hag "because he doesn't show respect for me", leading him to be disappointed with the communication of the club. Ronaldo claimed that ten Hag deliberately provoked him by first leaving him on the bench against City, <u>and then wanting to bring him on in the final moments against Tottenham,</u> but added that he regretted his decision to leave early. He also questioned the appointment of Rangnick the previous season as he was a "sporting director and not even a coach". On the club itself,<font color="blue" face="WildWest"> Ronaldo stated there was "no evolution" since the departure of former manager Alex Ferguson in 2013, despite expecting changes in "technology, infrastructure".</font> Ronaldo claimed that the Glazer family <u>"did not care about the club"</u> as he never spoke with them, and described United as a "marketing club". Following the interview, which aired in two-parts on 16 and 17 November, United began seeking legal action over whether Ronaldo had breached his contract, and were looking to terminate his contract. On 22 November, <mark>Ronaldo's contract was terminated by mutual agreement with immediate effect.</mark></p>
